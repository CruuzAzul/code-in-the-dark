## Demo 🔗



## Getting Started 🆕

To set up your event have a look at the file called `config/event.tsx` in this file you set up the reference image and the instruction. You can put your images in the public folder.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Basic usage

You will be greeted with a form if you access the root of the site. Here the participants can put in there name. They will now be sent to the editor.

### Warning

There has been no consideration about security and a bright person could maybe easily find a way to cheat 😅
